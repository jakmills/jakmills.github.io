        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jake Miller, a Computer Science Student with a passion for creating software.
            I am currently a Junior at Rowan University. I am currently interested in becoming a software engineer or cybersecurity specialist. 
            Both of these fields are interesting to me. I have always been interested in computers and technology. From a young age I was always fascinated by how computers worked. Eventually this led me to research hardware, and how computer parts interacted with each other.
            This then led me to build my own computer which ultimately sparked my interest in computer science. Throughout college, I always was interested in learning how to code, and to build projects. Learning to program really excited me,
            since that opened the door into creating software and websites. From here I joined Rowan's ACM chapter where I can connect with other students and professors who share my interests. I am also able to join committees, where I can
            learn more about different areas of computer science and technology.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project A (BlueWave):</strong> Built a Chat Application for ASRC federal in my Software Engineering 1 class. This application uses JavaFX for the front end, and uses Valkey for the backend which allows users to message each other. We are planning on implementing a database to keep track of users and their messages. This project uses JavaFX, Java, Valkey, MySQL, Maven, Valkey Cache, and Google's Protobuff.</li>
            <li><strong>Project B (Jash Sports):</strong> Built a web app that shows users past, current, and scheduled professional soccer matches. There is also a section that shows user's relevant news articles pertaining to all big leagues. Users also have the ability to search and favorite teams, as long as their are logged in. This project was built with Firebase, HTML/CSS/JS, and Java. Javalin was used to connect the frontend to the backend</li>
            <li><strong>Project C (Zerra):</strong> Building a file sharing web app, similar to google drive. User's will be able to upload files, and share them with their friends. This web app is being developed using React for the frontend and Spring Boot Web for the backend. We are also using Hibernate as well as Lombok.</li>
