        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jake Miller, a Computer Science Student with a passion for creating software.
            I am currently a Junior at Rowan University. I am currently interested in becoming a software engineer or cybersecurity specialist. 
            Both of these fields are interesting to me. I have always been interested in computers and technology. From a young age I was always fascinated by how computers worked. Eventually this led me to research hardware, and how computer parts interacted with each other.
            This then led me to build my own computer which ultimately sparked my interest in computer science. Throughout college, I always was interested in learning how to code, and to build projects. Learning to program really excited me,
            since that opened the door into creating software and websites. From here I joined Rowan's ACM chapter where I can connect with other students and professors who share my interests. I am also able to join committees, where I can
            learn more about different areas of computer science and technology.</p>
